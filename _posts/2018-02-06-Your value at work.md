MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern is often used in Web based applications, where `View` is your actual HTML content displayed on browser, where as "Controller" is the code that gather dynamic data and generates content within the HTML. Finally, "Model" talks about actual content, probably stored in DataBase or XML, and your business rules transform these contents based on user actions. <!--more-->
As I mentioned, MVC is most widely used in web based applications, but some how I liked this pattern and tried using it in my C++ application.
Scenario is, I have a module in C++ which generates set of System Information, and displays them to user. Since, they are system information, they keep change, and I have to update at view the same. Hope you understood.

Since I cannot get you what I wrote in my module, but I can surely show you a sample code, (the code is simple and self explanatory)
