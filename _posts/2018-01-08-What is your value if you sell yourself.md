title: "What's your value if you sell yourself"

This is not another simple topic I just thought of writing. I am sharing my experience with you. I wanted to clarify two words "sell yourself" and "value". It is relevant to use the word `market` in our current job situation. We all need to think twice on each step, neither are you trying to sell an unwanted, nor are you buying useless. In a life of market, same applies to what you are trying to convey to your buyer and what you are expecting from your seller. Unless there is a balance in `demand-and-supply` chain in your life, you cannot achieve success. Secondly, it is equally important you know correct `value` of your goods; neither you are over pricing and acting over smart nor you under price yourself to get bullied. <!--more-->
